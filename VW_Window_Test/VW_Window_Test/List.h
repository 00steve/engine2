/*The list class is a template class that lets the programmer
make an unordered list of any type that they choose.

This list is useful for speed intensive operations that do not
mind wasted ram. If only the Push and Pop functions are used
for adding and retrieving items, they will be returned in a
LIFO manner.

The Cut function lets you remove any specific item from the list
based on its index. The item that is removed is returned and the
last item on the list takes its place.

This list does not clear the indexes that are no longer used. If
the list is being used to hold pointers, it should not be that
big of a deal, since pointers have a small memory footprint, but
it can add up if tens or hundreds of thousands of pointers are
being used.
